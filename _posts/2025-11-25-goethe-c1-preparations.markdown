    <h2>How It Started: B1</h2>
    <p>
        Before we jump into the details of my C1 preparations, let's go one step back and
        talk about my previous experience with German language and German exams. It can
        help the reader do get the idea of the level, at which I started the preparations.  
    </p>

    <p>
        I have German roots and some members of my family spoke German. This braught me some
        basic knowledge of German grammar (like: verb is on the the second position in
        the sentence etc.) and some rudimentary words like "ich", "du", "Scheiße" and the verb 
        "sein" ("to be").
    </p>

    <p>
        With this baggage of knowledge I relocated to Germany in 2015. I hoped to survive
        with my relatively good English, but it was virtually impossible, especially in 
        Bayern. More over, in order to stay longer in Germany I needed the permanent 
        residence permit (aka "Niederlassungserlaubnis") and in order to get it I had to
        have a B1 language level. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Back in the day everything was really easy - I didn't need a lot of time for 
        preparations. Provided that B1 is not a cosmic level and I was dipped in the
        German environment - I could even say that I didn't prepare at all... not for
        the exam anyway.
    </p>

    <p>
        Apps like Duolingo and Memrise were helpful to learn some basic vocabulary and
        phrases. There were a lot of helpful YouTube videos provided by Goethe-Institut,
        Deutsche Welle and many others. I was always interested in football and I tried
        to read articles in German. At the later stages ZDF and it's crime series were 
        very helpful, especially because they had subtitles. But the biggest help were 
        of course my new bavarian neighbours: they were all trying to help me and my 
        family - not only with the language, but also in the living situations. That is 
        something for what I'll be greatful 'til my dying day.
    </p>

    <p>
        Summarising this B1 period of my life, I can say that "learning by doing" was a 
        perfect approach that allowed me eventually to pass my Goethe-Zertifikat B1 in 2018. 
        Three years of effortless and half-passive learning and I got from 0 to B1. Not bad.
    </p>

    <h2>C1. Decision</h2>
    <p>
        Every journey begins with the decision to go on this journey. Here we have the first
        difficulty I faced. Let's not even call it difficulty - it was an obvious mistake: I
        didn't formulate a clear reachable goal. I wanted to improve my German and "one" day
        speak "better". This uncertainty cost me 5 years. 
    </p>

    <p>
        It is not that I was not learning German, I, in fact, was. I spent many hours unsystematically
        watching YouTube videos with grammar and pronounciacion tips, I continued watching crime
        series on ZDF, I ever started reading some easy books like detective stories and light
        romans. Still I had a feeling that I'm on some sort of plato and not moving forward. I stuck. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In such a moment one must ask oneself, if he really needs to improve. B1 level allowed me to
        discuss simple topics, I could do my groceries and maintain a small talk. I could read 
        newspapers and watch news. But I wanted more. I often suffered from my inability to verbally
        express my way more complex thoughts, than my level allowed me to express. I wanted to read
        a serious literature. My favourite German authors are Kant, Schelling and Hegel. Once I tried
        to read Heinrich Mann and it was not really enjoyable - it was just way above my current level.
        I lso firmly decided that I want to tie my further life with Germany and get the citizenship. 
        Though there are no additional reuirements than B1 to become a citizen, I thought it's kind of
        logical to speak the lannguage if the country in which you are going to live the rest of your life.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an academically trained engineer I naturally strated looking for an academical solution. 
        What could be an achievable goal that would formally approve the growth of my German language
        skills for myself? In 2023 I decided that I have to take the Goethe-Institut-C1 exam and receive 
        the certificate.
    </p>

    <p>
        At that moment I did the mistake number two: clear goal without a formal deadline - I call it a
        dream, not a goal. I didn't even research the exam structure and topics. In fact, I only started
        the real exam preparations two years later, but at least the decision was made and I started more
        or less real preparations to my dream, that still improved my German enormously.
    </p>

    <h2>My Learning Approach</h2>
    <p>
        It was important for me to understand, what is the objective difference between B1 and C1. 
        I'll allow me to introduce a metaphor here: B1 - a level of the school pupil or a wroker, who's
        primary duties do not require complex verbal/written interactions. This a great starting point 
        for learning language: you can already understand the learning materials in the language you 
        learn. C1 on the other hand is the level that I would attribute to school graduate, who is on
        their journey to high school, or to some office worker, who doesn't communicate advanced topics,
        but their communication skills are of a high importance.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm convinced, that the easiest way to level up your language skills is to change your 
        environment. When I just came to Germany I tried to change my PC settings to be in German, I tried
        to consume news and information in German etc. It worked wonderfully. How could I change my 
        environemnt to fit my C1 endeavours? Let's look closer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Well, if you want to be like a school graduate, maybe you should read the literature that 
        school graduates read or already have read. I bought myself Goethe, Schiller and some other
        guys from the classical German literature. They were difficult for me at the start, but
        gradually I could read them and even enjoy them. I would like to mention brothers Grimm here:
        people say, that those fairy tails are for children and you can read them during B1 preparations.
        I strongly disagree. The vocabulary of brothers Grimm is way more advanced, it's a definite C1
        level. In fact, their vocabulary might well be richer than the one of Goethe ;) 
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to be like an office worker, then maybe... be one? In my case, a software engineer
        is to some certain degree is an office worker, but it has it's specific as a profession, plus,
        I work in an internation company and the communication languge is English here. Fortunately,
        I had a couple of German colleagues, who found my German sufficient for professional communication
        and we started discussing our job in German between us. That helped me enormously, not only as
        a practice, but also to boost my confidence level. I will never forget the kindness and patience
        of my colleagues, that meant a world to me.  
    </p>

    <p>
        Fortunately for my German preparations, we had problems with technical support in our company and
        it was decided, that I could help with answering emails. A support email quickly answered in a
        non-perfect German was considered to be better than an email that answered too late or not answered
        at all. This was a great opportunity for me to practice my writing skills. Unfortunately, later AI
        took my job... well, I mean, I started lazily answer emails with a help of AI instead of writing them myself.
    </p>

    <p>
        In that manner all four aspects - Reading, Listening, Writing and Speaking - were covered in my 
        day-to-day environment. But something important was still missing. The good old grammar. As I 
        already mentioned, I had been never learning German in a systematic way before and I never had 
        a proper grammar training. So this fundament was missing and it affected both quality of the 
        German I produced as well as my confidence. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Back in 2023 I bought two online cources from Lingster Academy: "Der komplette Grammatik-Kurs 
        (B1/B2)" and "Der ultimative C1-Kurs (B2/C1)". The first course allowed me to finally systematise
        my grammar knowledge, from some calleidoscopic ideas from endless YouTube videos to the proper
        understanding of the grammar rules and confident usage of such. The second course gave me an idea
        of what I should be able to do in order to be on te C1 level. This course was not only about 
        grammar, it touched all the exam objectives: I learned who the exam texts look like, what topics
        are waiting for me on the exam and I also had an opportunity to become a feedback on my writing
        skills from the real competent teachers. Sounds like unpaid promotion :) 
    </p>

    <p>
        That was my preparation plan. Looking back, I see, that though it looks quite solid on the paper now,
        the plan was not particularly a plan, but rather "let's do German" thing. If I would start now, I'd
        pay way more attention to practicing all the four exam objectives (Reading, Listening, Writing and
        Speaking) consistently and in a more controllable way on a daily basis. I would also focus more on
        the exam, not just on improving German in a broad sense. I'm still convinced that one shouldn't only
        prepare for the exam, without growing generally. On this level it will simply not work, you will 
        sound robotic, not fluent. But it's not a bad idea to make a couple of exam model tests per week,
        just to stay in touch with the topics and language that is reuired on the exam. One must understand,
        that those academical exams are quite narrowed and expect you to speak and write certain way, that
        is not necessarily the way one speaks in office or in informal situations.
    </p>

    <h2>The Exam Preparations</h2>
    <p>
        As I already mentioned in the previous section, being on the C1-level is not the same as being ready
        for a C1-exam. For me it was never a question, which exam to take: I had the Goethe-Zertifikat-B1, I
        wanted to have the Goethe-Zertifikat-C1. At some point I asked myself, if I may already be ready for
        the exam. It was 2025, as I said, it was a big mistake, that I started looking into exam materials 
        two years after I decided, that I want to take the exam. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I took a couple of model listening and reading tests and the results were good enough to think that 
        I'm close to be ready. I also watched the speaking exam video on the Goethe-Institut's YouTube channel - 
        I was convinced that I'm way stronger than both of the candidates in the video. The reality showed 
        later, that in my exam I was most likely weaker than the weakest candidate in the video: one should
        never confuse an exam situation with an informal small talk or even with a routine professional 
        conversation. Anyway, I decided that I'm ready and booked an exam appointment. It was end of June 2025, 
        approximately two months before the actual exam date.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first month was lazy. I was doing the same things I was doing last two years without even a sign of 
        acceleration. I was mostly procrastinating and watching random YouTube videos about the exam, instead
        of preparing for the exam. I think this phase is unavoidable, I always had that: in school, in university... always
        the same - a mixture of laziness, doubts, guilt and boredome. By the end of the months I started panicing.
        There was only 4-5 weeks left and I didn't feel prepared at all. I had to act.
    </p>

    <p>
        I realised, that I probably need help. Luckily Lingster Academy had an intensive online course for
        the people like myself called "C1 Prüfungsvorbereitung". In this course I got various reading and 
        listening model tests for both Telc and Goethe-Institute exams, they also offered a broad spectrum 
        of writing topics that students can use to write their texts and send it for correction. The course
        also had an option to simulate the speaking part, that I unfortunately never used because of lack of
        time. Lingster Academy also offers Zoom-conferences two times per week, where students of all the 
        courses can practice their spoken language. 
    </p>

    <p>
        My initial plan for the last 4-5 weeks was to focus on writing and speaking and to practice reading
        and listening one model test per day. The little I know, how much did I overestimate my cognitive 
        abilities and energy level.  
    </p>

    <p>
        The first problem that I realised is that it's extremely difficult for me to focus on something for
        more than 20-30 minutes. I have no idea, how I was functioning before, hw I was doing my job etc., but
        I felt completely exhausted for the rest of the day taking reading or listening test with the time 
        limit. It was apparently not an option to take both tests every day. In fact, it was even difficult to
        take one of those tests every day. I did maybe a couple of tests per week. The good news were that I 
        did it relatively good, around 80 point out of 100, so I decided to focus more on writing and speaking.
        As a result, on the exam I got 67 and 77 points out of 10 for reading and listening respectively. Is
        it good or is it bad? Well, taking in account that I didn't practice those parts a lot, plus the exam
        environment, that is always different from what you have in your cabinet at home. I'd say, the result
        is satisfactory. The lesson here is: once in a while practice listening and reading tests under time
        pressure in the noisy environment.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second problem - no - the catastrophy - was writing. For the last couple of years I have been 
        practicing writing only on PC with the help of vocabularies, Internet and, of course, AI. I had a
        feeling, that my texts are okay... in fact, I thought they were good... before I tried to write a
        text on the paper and gave it Chat-GPT to check. It was an epic failure. I couldn't structure my 
        thoughts, the words choice was primitive - and all that without any time pressure. I didn't even 
        dare to send such a lousy texts to my teachers from Lingster Academy. I focused on writing small 
        texts every day and checking them with Chat-GPT. I wrote 3-5 texts a day. It was horrible even the
        day before exam. What a miracle it was on the exam, where everything magically fit together and I 
        wrote two decent texts that gave me 96 point out of 100. Such a courage on the exam is not new to me,
        but it always surprises me.
    </p>

    <p>
        Speaking I also considered as my weakness as well, but I just hoped that with writing I will train the 
        vocabulary required for the exam and with those Zoom-conferences from Lingster Academy I gained some
        confidence. As I already mentioned, we couldn't make this speaking exam simulation with my teachers
        from Lingster Academy, because I was really so worried about the writing part, that I just hoped that 
        I would be lucky and the speaking part of te exam will somehow miraculously work out by itself. 
        On the exam I got 85 out of 100, not a bad result, taking in account that I was
        totally exhausted and foolishly had a heavy meal before this part of the exam, which made me sleepy.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        I need to somehow logically finish this long read, so it doesn't look like a diary of a madman. 
        It's probably the right time to reflect on what I did right and what had to be done differently. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The right decision was not to be too much focused on the exam, but rather on the level. I spend
        years reading quite an advance literature, involving myself in the work-activities that would 
        require me to grow and learn in the real lief situations. I could spend this time just mechanically
        remembering phrases and turns of speech, that would doubtfully be useful for the exam, but wouldn't
        bring me on the next level. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The wrong part is not to take the exam in consideration at all. The topics of the exam, the style
        of speech and the ability to listen, read and write under pressure - are very important and can not
        be sufficiently trained in the last month. If I had practiced these things at least once a week in the
        last two years - my results would be significantly better and I could even be ready for the exam 
        way earlier.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm generally satisfied with the experience I got. There was something to learn and to think about,
        which is not only related to the exam, but rather to my general abilities to preform an intelectual
        work. Lack of planing, lack of concentration etc. - all those things are quite important to work on. 
        I hope to improve these things in the future and apply them next time. But we will talk about "next time"
        next time :) In the next post.
    </p>

    <p>Thanks for reading, and see you soon!</p>
