  In the second part of my "Goethe-Zertifikat C1" trilogy I'd like to share my
  approach of preparing to this exam and maybe reflect a little bit of what I think
  I was doing right and what I think I was doing wrong. I'm not a lingustical expert,
  do not expect to get some professional advice from this post - there are a
  lot of people on the internet, who provide such an advices. I just dare to hope that
  you will find something interesting and helpful for you in this long post.
  Grab your coffee and let's get started!

    <h2>How It Started: B1</h2>
    <p>
        Before we jump into the details of my C1 preparations, let's go one step back and
        talk about my previous experience with German language and German exams. It can
        help the reader do get the idea of the level, at which I started the preparations.  
    </p>

    <p>
        I have German roots and some members of my family spoke German. This braught me some
        primitive knowledge of German grammar (like: verb is on the the second position in
        the sentence etc.) and some basic words like "ich", "du", "Scheiße" and the verb 
        "sein" ("to be").
    </p>

    <p>
        With this baggage of knowledge I relocated to Germany in 2015. I hoped to survive
        with my relatively good English, but it was virtually impossible, especially in 
        Bayern. More over, in order to stay longer in Germany I needed the permanent 
        residence permit (aka "Niederlassungserlaubnis") and in order to get it I had to
        have a B1 language level. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Back in the day everything was really easy - I didn't need a lot of time for 
        preparations. Provided that B1 is not a cosmic level and I was dipped in the
        German environment - I could even say that I didn't prepare at all... not for
        the exam anyway.
    </p>

    <p>
        Apps like Duolingo and Memrise were helpful to learn some basic vocabulary and
        phrases. There were a lot of helpful YouTube videos provided by Goethe-Institut,
        Deutsche Welle and many others. I was always interested in football and I tried
        to read articles in German. At the later stages ZDF and it's crime series were 
        very helpful, especially because they had subtitles. But the biggest help were 
        of course my new bavarian neighbours: they were all trying to help me and my 
        family - not only with the language, but also in the living situations. That is 
        something for what I'll be greatful 'til my dying day.
    </p>

    <p>
        Summarising this B1 period of my life, I can say that "learning by doing" was a 
        perfect approach that allowed me eventually to pass my Goethe-Zertifikat B1 in 2018. 
        Three years of effortless and half-passive learning and I got from 0 to B1. Not bad.
    </p>

    <h2>C1. Decision</h2>
    <p>
        I want to read serious literature: school boy, Abiturient, university student
        analogy or physical worker, intellectual worker, intellectual worker in the
        lead position 
    </p>
    <p>Mistake: no formal deadlines </p>

    <h2>C1: Approach</h2>
    <p>Environment and applications: German at work, not just supermarkets</p>
    <p>
        Fundament (grammar) + practice (Support Emails, Phone calls, German as
        a spoken language at work, appropriate literature Krimis -> Goethe, Schiller)
    </p>
    <p>
        Mistakes: prepare for the exam topics and vocabulary for a longer period, 
        than a couple of months; focus on listening, reading, writing, speaking, 
        not just „do German“; all parts during the day/week is better than months
        of reading, then two months of watching movies. Working on concentration -> huge problem
    </p>
    
    <h2>Courses (Julia)</h2>
    <p>Mistakes: avoiding speaking</p>    

    <h2>When did I decide, that I’m ready? Speaking exam video.</h2>

    <h2>Conclusion: what was good, what I would do differently?</h2>

    <p>Thanks for reading, and see you in the next part!</p>
