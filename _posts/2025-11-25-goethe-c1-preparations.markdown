    <h2>How It Started: B1</h2>
    <p>
        Before jumping into the details of my C1 preparations, let's go one step back and
        talk about my previous experience with the German language and German exams. This
        can help the reader understand the level at which I started.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_Germans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">German roots</a>, and some
        members of my family spoke the language. This brought me a bit of basic grammar knowledge
        (like "the verb is in the second position") and some essential words: "ich", "du", "Scheiße",
        and of course the verb "sein".
    </p>

    <p>
        With this modest baggage I relocated to Germany in 2015. I hoped to survive with my
        relatively good English, but that was virtually impossible — especially in Bayern.
        Moreover, to stay longer I needed a permanent residence permit ("Niederlassungserlaubnis"),
        and for that I had to prove B1.
    </p>

    <p>
        Back then everything was easy: I didn't need much preparation. B1 is not a cosmic level,
        and being fully immersed in a German environment practically replaced studying. I could
        even say I didn't really prepare at all… not specifically for the exam anyway.
    </p>

    <p>
        Apps like <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duolingo</a> and
        <a href="https://www.memrise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Memrise</a> helped me learn basic vocabulary and phrases.
        There were tons of helpful YouTube videos from Goethe-Institut, Deutsche Welle, and others.
        Since I've always liked football, I tried reading football articles in German. Later,
        <a href="https://www.zdf.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZDF</a> and its crime series helped enormously — especially
        with subtitles. But the biggest help came from my Bavarian neighbours: they tried to support
        my family and me in everything — not only with language but with daily life. That's something
        I'll be grateful for until my dying day.
    </p>

    <p>
        Summarising this B1 chapter of my life: "learning by doing" worked perfectly and eventually
        allowed me to pass the Goethe-Zertifikat B1 in 2018. Three years of effortless, half-passive
        learning — and I went from 0 to B1. Not bad.
    </p>

    <h2>C1. Decision</h2>
    <p>
        Every journey begins with a decision. Here came the first difficulty — or rather, the first
        obvious mistake: I didn't set a clear, reachable goal. I just vaguely wanted to "improve my
        German" and "speak better one day". This uncertainty cost me five years.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's not that I wasn't learning German. I was — but unsystematically. I spent hours watching
        random grammar and pronunciation videos on YouTube, kept watching ZDF crime series, and even
        started reading easy books like detective stories and light novels. Still, I felt stuck on
        some sort of plateau. I wasn't moving forward.
    </p>

    <p>
        At such a moment one must ask oneself whether improvement is even necessary. B1 was enough
        for simple topics, groceries, small talk, reading newspapers and watching the news. But I
        wanted more. I often suffered because I couldn't express more complex thoughts. I wanted to
        read serious literature. My favourite German authors are
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kant</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Schelling</a>, and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hegel</a>. I once tried
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Mann" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heinrich Mann</a> — it was not enjoyable
        at all, just way above my level. I also firmly decided I wanted to tie my future life to Germany
        and get the citizenship. Technically, B1 is enough for citizenship, but I still thought: if you
        want to live here for the rest of your life, maybe speak the language properly.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an academically trained engineer, I naturally looked for an academic solution. What would
        be an achievable goal to formally confirm my progress? In 2023 I made the decision to work
        toward the Goethe-Zertifikat C1.
    </p>

    <p>
        At that moment I made mistake number two: a clear goal without a deadline is just a dream.
        I didn't even research the exam structure or topics. In fact, I started actual exam preparation
        two years later. Still — the decision existed, and that already pushed my German forward.
    </p>

    <h2>My Learning Approach</h2>
    <p>
        It was important to understand the objective
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">difference between B1 and C1</a>.
        Let me introduce a metaphor: B1 is the level of a school pupil or a worker whose duties don't
        require complex verbal/written interactions. It's a great starting point, because you already
        understand learning materials in the target language. C1, on the other hand, is a level I'd
        associate with a school graduate heading to university, or an office worker whose communication
        skills matter but who doesn't necessarily deal with deeply specialised topics.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm convinced that the easiest way to level up is to change your environment. When I first
        moved to Germany, I switched my PC to German, consumed German news, etc. It worked wonderfully.
        So: how could I change my environment to fit a C1 endeavour?
    </p>

    <p>
        Well, if you want to be like a school graduate, maybe read what school graduates read. I bought
        Goethe, Schiller and some other guys from classical German literature. Difficult at first — but
        gradually enjoyable. I should mention the Brothers Grimm: people say their fairy tales are for
        children and suitable for B1. I strongly disagree. Their vocabulary is far more advanced,
        definitely C1. It might even be richer than Goethe's 😉
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to be like an office worker, then… be one? As a software engineer, I'm kind of an
        office worker, but the job has its specifics, plus I work in an international company where
        English is the main language. Fortunately, some German colleagues found my German sufficient
        for professional communication, and we started discussing our work in German. That helped
        enormously — not only as practice but also for confidence. I'll never forget their kindness
        and patience.
    </p>

    <p>
        Parallel to that, another important factor helped me improve. We had issues with technical support,
        and it was decided I could help answer emails. A quick support email in imperfect German was
        considered better than a perfectly formulated but very late one. This became a great writing exercise.
        Unfortunately, AI later took my job — meaning I got lazy and let AI answer emails instead of writing
        them myself.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this way, all four skills — Reading, Listening, Writing, Speaking — were covered in my daily
        life. But something important was missing: grammar. I'd never learned German systematically, never
        had proper grammar training. This foundation was missing and affected both the quality of my German
        and my confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
        Back in 2023 I bought two online courses from <a href="https://lingster.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lingster Academy</a>:
        "Der komplette Grammatik-Kurs (B1/B2)" and "Der ultimative C1-Kurs (B2/C1)". The first one
        finally systematised my grammar — from a kaleidoscope of random YouTube bits to a proper
        understanding of rules and confident usage. The second course gave me an idea of what I should
        be able to do at C1. It wasn't only grammar; it introduced exam objectives, typical texts,
        topics, and even allowed me to get feedback from real teachers. Sounds like unpaid promotion 😊
    </p>

    <p>
        That was my preparation "plan". Looking back, it's clear it wasn't really a plan — more of a "let's
        do German" approach. If I started again, I'd practise all four exam objectives (Reading, Listening,
        Writing, Speaking) consistently on a daily basis. I'd also focus more on the exam itself, not only
        on general growth. I'm still convinced you shouldn't <i>only</i> prepare for an exam — otherwise
        you sound robotic. But doing a couple of model tests per week to stay familiar with the style and
        requirements is a good idea. Academic exams are narrow — they expect a specific style that's not
        necessarily how people speak in real life.
    </p>

    <h2>The Exam Preparations</h2>
    <p>
        As already mentioned, being at C1 and being ready for a C1 exam are not the same. For me there
        was no doubt which exam to take: I had Goethe B1, so I wanted Goethe C1. At some point I asked
        myself whether I might already be ready. It was 2025 — yes, I made the big mistake of only
        checking exam materials two years after deciding to take the exam.
    </p>

    <p>
        I took a couple of model listening and reading tests, and the results looked good enough to
        believe I was close. I also watched the speaking exam
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoD9dnTidxw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>
        on Goethe-Institut's YouTube channel and was convinced I was stronger than both candidates.
        Reality later showed that in my exam I was probably weaker than the weaker candidate in that
        video. One should never confuse an exam situation with an informal conversation or even a
        routine professional discussion. Anyway, I decided I was ready and booked the exam. It was the
        end of June 2025, about two months before the date.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first month was lazy. I kept doing the same things I'd been doing for two years — no
        acceleration at all. Mostly procrastination and random YouTube videos about the exam instead
        of preparing. This phase is probably unavoidable: a mixture of laziness, doubts, guilt, and
        boredom. By the end of the month I started panicking. Only 4–5 weeks left, and I didn't feel
        prepared at all. Time to act.
    </p>

    <p>
        I realised I needed help. Luckily Lingster Academy had an intensive course called
        "C1 Prüfungsvorbereitung". It included various model tests for both Telc and Goethe,
        a wide range of writing topics for students to submit, and even the option to simulate
        the speaking part (which I unfortunately never used due to lack of time). They also
        organise group speaking sessions on Zoom twice a week.
    </p>

    <p>
        My initial plan for the last 4–5 weeks was to focus on writing and speaking and to do one
        reading and one listening test per day. Little did I know how much I overestimated my
        cognitive abilities and energy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Problem number one: focusing for more than 20–30 minutes was extremely hard. I don't know
        how I functioned before or how I managed my job, but after taking a timed reading or
        listening test I felt exhausted for the rest of the day. Doing both every day was impossible;
        even doing one daily was difficult. I completed maybe two per week. The good news: in the model
        tests at home I scored around 80/100, so I shifted my focus to writing and speaking.
        In the real exam I later got 67 and 77 points, for reading and listening respectively.
        Is that good or bad? Considering I hardly practised them and the exam environment is always
        different from your quiet home office — I'd say satisfactory. The lesson: occasionally practise
        under time pressure and in a noisy environment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Problem number two — no, catastrophe — was writing. For years I'd been writing only on a PC
        with dictionaries, the internet and AI. I thought my texts were fine… until I tried writing
        by hand and asked <a href="https://chatgpt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT</a> to check them. Epic failure.
        I couldn't structure thoughts, my vocabulary collapsed to something primitive — and that was
        without time pressure. I didn't even dare send such texts to my teachers. I started writing
        small texts daily and checking them with ChatGPT — 3–5 texts a day. It was horrible until the
        day before the exam. And yet, miraculously, on the exam everything fit together and I wrote two
        decent texts that gave me 96/100. Courage (or luck) in exams isn't new to me, but it always
        surprises me.
    </p>

    <p>
        Speaking was also a weakness, but I hoped that practising writing would give me the necessary
        vocabulary and the Lingster Zoom meetings would help confidence. As mentioned, I never did
        a proper speaking simulation because I was too stressed about writing. I simply hoped speaking
        would magically work out. In the exam I got 85/100 — not a bad result considering I was exhausted
        and stupidly had a heavy meal before this part, which made me sleepy.
    </p>

    <p>
        All the specifics of the exam day itself are in <a href="/2025/11/19/goethe-c1-exam.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part I</a> of this series.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        I should finish this long read somehow, so it doesn't look like a diary of a madman. It's probably
        the right moment to reflect on what I did right and what could have been done differently.
    </p>

    <p>
        The good part was focusing on the level, not just the exam. I spent years reading advanced
        literature and involving myself in situations that forced me to grow. I could have spent this
        time mechanically memorising phrases for the exam — but that wouldn't have brought me to the
        next level.
    </p>

    <p>
        The bad part was ignoring the exam completely. The exam topics, the style, the ability to work
        under pressure — these things can't be trained sufficiently in one month. Had I practised them
        once a week during the previous two years, my results would have been significantly better, and
        I might have been ready earlier.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, I'm satisfied with the experience. There was a lot to learn — not only about the exam,
        but about my general ability to perform intellectual work. Lack of planning, lack of
        concentration — all these things matter. I hope to improve them and apply them next time. But
        we'll talk about "next time" next time :) In the next post.
    </p>

    <p>Thanks for reading, and see you soon!</p>
