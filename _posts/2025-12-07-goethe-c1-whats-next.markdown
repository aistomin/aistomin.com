        This is the third and final part of my "Goethe-Zertifikat C1" trilogy.
        In this part I want to share my thoughts regarding the C2 certification:
        whether I'm going to do it or not and, if yes, what concrete steps I
        need to take in order to achieve it. So, let me make God laugh and share
        my plans with you — and with Him.

    <h2>To C2 or not to C2 — That's The Question!</h2>
    <p>
        I already mentioned in the previous part that my main reason for getting
        the C1 level was the desire to read serious German literature and to be
        able to communicate complex thoughts. But does this level really provide
        that? In a broad sense, yes: I can read and even understand Kant, I can
        more or less fluently articulate my thoughts in my work environment.
        Still, it's not really enough.
    </p>
    <p>
        What's the point of reading Kant if you can't really discuss it with
        someone? I'm definitely able to talk about topics more serious than the
        weather, but I'm far from being able to freely talk about philosophical
        matters. In some sense it even got worse: on the B1 level you formulate
        a simple thought, look for the basic linguistic instruments you have
        (and there aren't many) — and express it. On the C1 level you think
        you're fluent and often overestimate your abilities — the sentences
        come out clumsy, stylistically inconsistent and grammatically incorrect.
        That ruins the whole impression of the speech — verbal or written.
    </p>
    <p>
        So yes, the C1 level is not something I can be fully satisfied with.
        The show must go on.
    </p>

    <h2>What is The Plan?</h2>
    <p>
        I shouldn't repeat the same mistake I made transitioning from B1 to C1,
        when I was just "learning German", hoping that it would somehow level me
        up. Without at least a rough plan this will take years. I have some
        ideas about what I need to do this time. Let me share them with you.
    </p>
    <p>
        As it often happens, when going to the next level you have to forget
        what you learned on the previous one and start from scratch. Yes, I mean
        the fundament: the grammar. The first unavoidable step is to seriously
        revisit and master German grammar. Although I understand almost all the
        concepts, I still haven't mastered them. It's embarrassing when you
        explain an interesting idea using advanced vocabulary and grammar
        structures — and then make a silly grammatical mistake. A mistake you
        immediately notice yourself and think: "What a fool!" This can only be
        fixed by targeting the grammar topics where I fail and practicing them
        consciously. I need solid materials to master the grammar. Exercises,
        exercises, and then a little more exercises.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second important step is to level up the — what I call —
        "environment". The surroundings and the application of the language are
        crucial for me. When I went from B1 to C1, I started using German in my
        work environment. Now I need to level that up again. How? I'm not the
        youngest anymore and I have my daily duties, so I can't afford to go to
        university and study a new subject. What I can do, though, is use German
        as a hobby philosopher. Philosophy was always my passion. Why not go
        this way and try to study philosophy in German? Not just read
        philosophical books, but actually study the subject. Not just passively
        consume information, but actively process it and turn it into verbal or
        written artifacts. That would allow me to regularly practice all four
        areas tested on the exam. Let's look at each of them individually.
    </p>
    <p>
        Reading. I already have a good library of philosophy books from Plato
        to Nietzsche. I need to read them. This time the reading can't be
        passive. I have to study them: actively write outlines and process
        in detail what I've just read. Maybe even write an essay.
    </p>
    <p>
        Writing. Combining writing and reading may be a good idea. So maybe
        "study" is indeed the right word: read about a certain topic, process
        the information, then write. Maybe I should start a philosophy blog.
        It's going to be time-consuming, but one can't make an omelette without
        cracking eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Listening and Speaking. Here I have a problem. Listening to
        philosophical podcasts or lectures is good, but it lacks the spontaneity
        of real-time speech. Speaking is even worse: whom would I talk to about
        my Kantian research? I don't have anyone around me who would be
        interested in such topics. I was thinking of looking for a — what we
        Germans call — "Verein" (hobby club, society, association dedicated to a
        certain topic). We have a Verein for everything: sport, stitching,
        bird-watching... maybe there's one for philosophy or at least literature.
        I bet there is; one just needs to take the time and search. Being a
        member of such a club would allow me to regularly train my speaking and
        listening skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last and very important step is to prepare for the exam itself. I
        should not repeat my previous mistake of starting preparation in the
        last month. I plan to find model tests as early as possible and practice
        them, if not weekly, then at least monthly. The exam topics must not be
        overlooked either: climate change, digitalisation — whatever they have
        on the exam, not necessarily what Kant writes about. I should be aware
        of those topics and the vocabulary that goes along with them. I also
        have to regularly make timed tests and maybe even do them in cafés or
        other noisy places, because distractions and the lack of concentration
        were among my issues in the C1 exam.
    </p>

    <h2>ETA</h2>
    <p>
        As I like to say: a plan without time estimations is just a dream.
        Though I'm sceptical about long-term planning — and the last years
        with pandemics, wars etc. prove that our plans can be easily ruined by
        circumstances we cannot control — I still have to give an initial
        estimation and some time limits to discipline myself.
    </p>
    <p>
        I may be naive, but I think that two years should be enough to level up:
        master the grammar, become confident using complex language in verbal
        and written form, quickly understand complex texts and audio etc. So in
        two years from now I could actually be on the C2 level. That doesn't
        mean, though, that I will already be ready for the exam.
    </p>
    <p>
        This time I want to take way more than one month to prepare specifically
        for the exam. Ideally 3–6 months, so I can reduce the stress of the last
        days before it. At that phase — no Kant, just model tests every damn day.
    </p>
    <p>
        So my ETA is around 2.5–3 years to level up. I'm not trying to be
        precise; it's just something to start with and not to waste seven years
        wandering in the dark, as I did with C1.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        This post may look like a random rant and dream-sharing, but I want to
        believe that this plan will be a good starting point on my journey to C2
        and help me stay accountable. It won't be easy, and the plan will
        probably change every month or even more frequently, but it's still
        better than having no plan at all. It will also be interesting to see
        how different the reality will be from what I'm planning now. I'll keep
        you updated if I have something interesting to share on this topic
        again. Wish me good luck with the preparations!
