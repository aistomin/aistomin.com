    <h2>To C2 or not to C2, that's the question!</h2>
    <p>
        I already mentioned in the previous part, that my main reason of getting
        the C1-Level was a desire to read serious German literature and
        to be able to communicate complex thoughts. But does this level really
        provides me that? In a broad sense, yes: I can read and even understand 
        Kant, I can more or less fluently articulate my thoughts in my work environment.
        Still it's not really enough. 
    </p>
    <p>
        What's the point of reading Kant, if you can not really discuss it with someone? 
        I'm definitely able to talk about topics more serious than discussing weather,
        but I'm far away from being able to freely talk about philosophical matters. In
        some sense it got even worse: on the B1-Level you formulate a simple thought, 
        look for the basic linguistic instruments that you have (and you do not have that much)
        - and express it; on the C1-Level you think you're fluent and often overestimate
        your abilities - the sentences are coming out clumpsy, inconsistent in style 
        and grammatically incorrect. That ruins the whole impression of the speech - verbal
        or written.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, definitely, C1-Level is not something that I can be fully satisfied with. The show 
        must go on. 
    </p>

    <h2>What is the plan?</h2>
    <p>
        I should not make the same mistake as I did transitioning from B1 to C1, when I was just
        "learning German" hoping that it will level me up. Without at least a rough plan this will
        take years and years. I have some ideas, what I have to do this time. Let me share it with 
        you.
    </p>
    <p>
        As it often happens, when it comes to the next level, you have to forget, what you've 
        learned on the previous level and start from scratch. Yes, of course, I'm talking 
        again about the fundament: the grammar. The first unavoidable step of my plan is to seriously
        revisit and master the German grammar. Though I have quite a good understanding of almost all
        the concepts of it, I still haven't mastered it yet. It's embarassing, when you explain
        some interesting idea, using advanced vocabulary and grammar forms and make a silly
        grammatical mistake. The mistake, that you catch immediately yourself and think: 
        "What a fool!". It can only be fixed by targeting the grammar topics where I fail
        and practicing them conciously. It will be necessary to find a solid materials to
        master the grammar. Exercises, excercises and then a little bit more exercises.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second important step that I have to make is to level up the - what I call -
        "environment". The surroundings and the application of the language are crucial for me.
        I started using German in my work environment when I went from B1 to C1. I need
        to level it up. How? I'm not the youngest anymore and I have my daily duties, so
        I can not afford myself to go to the university and study a new subject. What I
        definitely can do though, is to use German as a hobby philosopher. Philosophy was
        always my passion. Why don't go this way and don't try to study philosophy in German?
        Not just read the philosophy books, but study the subject. Not just passively consume
        the information, but also actively process it and convert to verbal or written artifacts. 
        That would allow me to regularly practice all the four areas, that will be tested on
        the exam. Let's talk about each of them individually. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Reading. I already have quite a good library of philosophy books from Plato to Nietzsche. 
        I need to read them. This time reading must not be passive. I have to study them: actively
        writing outlines and processing in details, what just have been read. Maybe write an essay.
    </p>

    <p>
        Speaking of Writing: Combining writing and reading may be a good idea. So maybe "study" is
        the right word: read about certain thema, process the information, then write. May I should 
        start a philosophy blog. It's going to be time-consuming, but one can't make an omlette without
        cracking eggs. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Listening and Speaking. Here I have a problem. Listening philosopical podcasts or lectures
        is a good, but it lacks spontanity of the real-time speech. With the speaking the situation
        is even worse: whom would I tell about my kantianian researches? I do not have any people in
        my surrounding who would be interested in such a topics. I was thinking of looking for a - what
        we Germans call - "Verein" (hobby club, society, association dedicated to certain thema). We have
        a "Verein" for everything: sport, stitching or watching birds... maybe we have something for 
        philosophy or at least literature. I bet we have something, one should just take time and search. Being
        a memeber of such a club would allow me to regulary train my speaking and listening skills.
    </p>

    <p>
        The last and very important step is to prepare for the exam itself. I should no repeat my previous 
        mistake and start preparing in the last month. I plan to find model tests as early as possible and 
        practice them, if not on weekly, then at least on monthly basis. The exam topics must also not be overlooked:
        climate change, digitalisation - what they have on the exam - not necessarily what Kant writes 
        about - I should be aware of those topics and the vocabulary that goes along with them. I also have to regularly
        make timed tests and maybe even do them somewhere in a café or other noisy places, because distractions and 
        a lack of concentration were among my issues in the C1-exam.
    </p>

    <h2>ETA</h2>
    <p>
        As I love to say: plan without any time estimations is just a dream. Though I'm quite sceptical of 
        making long term plans - and last years with pandemics, wars etc. prove that all our plans can be 
        easily ruined by the circumstances that we can not control - I still have to give an initial 
        estimation and some time limits that would discipline me.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I may be naive, but I think that two years must be enough to level up: master the grammar, be confident
        using complex language in verbal and written form, quickly understand complex texts and audio etc. So in
        two years from now I could be actually on the C2-Level. That doesn't mean though, that I will be ready for
        the exam.
    </p>
    <p>
        This time I would take way more than one month to prepare specifically for the exam. I'd like to take
        3-6 months, so I could decrease the amount of stress of the last days before the exam. At that phase
        - no Kant, just model tests every damn day.  
    </p>
    <p>
        So, my ETA is 2.5 - 3 years in order to level up. I'm not trying being precise, it's just something to start
        with and not to waste 7 years wandering in the dark, as I did with C1. 
    </p>


    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        This post may look like just a random rant and dreams-sharing, but I do want to believe, that this
        plan will be a good strating point on my journey to C2 and will help me to be accountable.
        It won't be easy and the plan will be changing every next month or even more frequently, but it's still
        better than having no plan at all. It will also be interesting to see, how much the reality will be 
        different from what I'm planing now. I will keep you updated, if I have something interesting to 
        share on this topic again. Wish me a good luck with the preparations!
