    <p>I was born in 1985 in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirghiz_Soviet_Socialist_Republic">Kyrgyz SSR</a>. From an early age I was curious about how things work, whether in nature, stories, or later, technology. I attended an elite physics-mathematical lyceum in Bishkek and went on to Russian-Slavic University, where I studied computer science and discovered that programming could be both practical and creative.</p>

    <p>I started my professional career with C# and Visual Studio, working on ERP systems and payment processing solutions for mobile operators. Later I moved to Java and Spring, including a parliamentary election system project where I first worked with Linux in production. At one point I was part of a payments-integration team, working with providers such as Skrill and Webmoney.</p>

    <p>In 2014 I began freelancing for a client I met that year, building backend systems in Java and Grails with Postgres, and implementing payment integrations with PayPal, Ogone, Stripe, and Klarna. In 2015 this work brought me to Germany on a Blue Card, where I transitioned into a permanent role. Over the years, my focus expanded to DevOps and software architecture, gradually taking on team leadership, maintaining complex systems, and ensuring projects are reliable and practical.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I've always been drawn to music and philosophy. I take guitar lessons in Germany and share some of my <a href="https://andy-grails.de">work</a>. My philosophical interests range from classical literature to German philosophy — Kant, Hegel, Feuerbach, and Schelling — which continue to shape how I approach problems, systems, and the world.</p>
